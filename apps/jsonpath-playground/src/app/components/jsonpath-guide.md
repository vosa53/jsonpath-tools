JSONPath ([RFC 9535](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9535/)) is a simple query language to extract or select values in a JSON document.

JSONPath *query* is a sequence of *segments* that consist of *selectors* to select or filter values from objects/arrays. Each selector works with the values outputed by the previous selector. The character `$` represents the query argument (JSON document root), and every query has to start with it.

### Name Selector

The most simple selector is a *name selector*, which selects a value from the object property:

```jsonpath
$.dealership.location
```
Which is a shorthand syntax for:
```jsonpath
$["dealership"]["location"]
```

### Index Selector

Similarly, an *index selector* is used for arrays:
```jsonpath
$.dealership.inventory[2]
```

Arrays are indexed **from zero**. It is also possible to index from end, negative indices are used for this:
```jsonpath
$.dealership.inventory[-1]
```
The previous query selects the **last** item from the inventory (item at `length - 1`).

### Wildcard Selector

A *wildcard selector* `*` can be used to select all values from an object/array:
```jsonpath
$.dealership.inventory[*]
```
Or alternatively:
```jsonpath
$.dealership.inventory.*
```

### Slice Selector
To select a range of elements from an array, the *slice selector* is available. Its parameters are start index (inclusive), end index (exclusive), and step. It uses the syntax: `start:end:step`. Each of these parameters can be omitted, in which case a default value is used.

For the following examples suppose 5 elements in the `inventory` array.

Selects elements at `2`, `3`:
```jsonpath
$.dealership.inventory[2:4]
```

Selects the first 3 elements (`0`, `1`, `2`):
```jsonpath
$.dealership.inventory[:3]
```

Selects elements at `1`, `3`:
```jsonpath
$.dealership.inventory[1:5:2]
```

Selects every second element (`0`, `2`, `4`):
```jsonpath
$.dealership.inventory[::2]
```

Selects all elements (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`):
```jsonpath
$.dealership.inventory[:]
```
The previous query can be used as an alternative to `*`, but only for arrays.

Negative values are also allowed for all parameters. For example, the following query selects all elements, but in the **reverse order** (`4`, `3`, `2`, `1`, `0`):
```jsonpath
$.dealership.inventory[::-1]
```

### Filter Selector
The most powerful is a *filter selector*. It allows to select array/object values based on a logical expression with nested queries. It is preceded by `?` character. The current filtered value in the expression is represented with a `@` character.

A simple filter can look like this:
```jsonpath
$.dealership.inventory[?@.make == "Ford"]
```
It selects all values where `make` property is equal to `Ford`.

#### Comparison Operators

All available comparison operators are summarized in this table:
| Operator | Description             |
|----------|-------------------------|
| `==`       | Equal                 |
| `!=`       | Not equal             |
| `<`        | Lower than            |
| `>`        | Greater than          |
| `<=`       | Lower than or equal   |
| `>=`       | Greater than or equal |

#### Existence Test

If no operator is used, the nested query is considered an existence test. Empty subquery result means `LogicalFalse` and not empty `LogicalTrue`.

For example, the following example selects all cars that have `Bluetooth` element between their features:
```jsonpath
$.dealership.inventory[?@.features[?@ == "Bluetooth"]]
```

#### Logical Operators

Logical expressions can be combined with the following operators:
| Operator | Description                       |
|----------|-----------------------------------|
| `&&`       | Logical AND (all true)          |
| `\|\|`     | Logical OR (some true)          |
| `!`        | Logical NOT (not true)          |

Operator `&&` has higher precedence than `||`. It is also possible to use parenthesis `(` and `)` to change the precedences.

#### Functions

Filter expressions can also use *functions*. These functions use a simple type system with the following types:

- `ValueType`: JSON value (object, array, number, ...) or a special value `Nothing`.
- `LogicalType`: Represents logical expression values, either `LogicalTrue` or `LogicalFalse`. **Note: These values are distinct from the JSON values `true` and `false`.**
- `NodesType`: Lists of JSON values along with their positions (*nodelist*). Represents a result of a query.

A type `NodesType` can be implicitly converted to `LogicalType` (similar to the previously mentioned existence test).

There are 5 built-in functions:
- `length(ValueType): ValueType`: Gets the length of a value.
- `count(NodesType): ValueType`: Counts the number of nodes.
- `match(ValueType, ValueType): LogicalType`: Matches a text against a pattern.
- `search(ValueType, ValueType): LogicalType`: Searches a text for a pattern.
- `value(NodesType): ValueType`: Gets a value of a node.

#### I-Regexp - Regular Expressions

To ensure interoperability between programming languages, JSONPath filter functions use a simplified, standardized subset of common regular expressions called *I-Regexp* ([RFC 9485](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9485/)).

I-Regexp supports the following patterns:

- Dot representing any character.
- Character classes (e.g. `[a-zA-Z0-9_]`). Including a negation with `^`.
- Unicode character categories (e.g. `\p{L}`).
- Quantifiers `?`, `+` and `*`.
- Range and exact quantifier (e.g. `{1,5}` a `{3}`).
- Branching with `|`.
- Subexpression in paranthesis `(` and `)`.

It lacks more advanced features like lookahead or capture groups.

### Multiple Selectors

A single segment (represented with a `[` and `]`) can contain multiple selectors. For example, the following query selects the first employee and also the one with the name `Mike Johnson`.

```jsonpath
$.dealership.employees[0, ?@.name == "Mike Johnson"]
```

A value can also be selected multiple times.

### Descendant Segments

JSONPath segments are actually of two types: *child segment* and *descendant segment*. The ones shown so far were child segments because they operated only on the value itself. Descendant selectors operate on the value and also on all its descendants.

The descendant segment uses a syntax of two dots `..`.

For example, the following query selects the property `id` from every object in the document:

```jsonpath
$..id
```

Equivalent to a longer form:
```jsonpath
$..["id"]
```

### Query Output

The output of each query is a sequence of JSON values, along with their positions in the query argument (*nodes*) called *nodelist*. 

A special form of a JSONPath query, called a *normalized path*, can be used to uniquely identify a node in the query argument. A normalized path is a JSONPath query syntactically constrained in a way that each node corresponds to exactly one normalized path, and each normalized path leads to at most one node.

For example, consider this query, which outputs one node:
```jsonpath
$.dealership.inventory[-1]
```

The normalized path to the result node of this query is the following:

```jsonpath
$['dealership']['inventory'][4]
```
