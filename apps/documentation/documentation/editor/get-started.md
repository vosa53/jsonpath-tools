# Get Started with Editor

For common editor use cases there is currently available a [component for React framework](react-component.md). 
It provides default styles that can be overriden.

For advanced use cases and other frameworks is intended [CodeMirror editor extension](codemirror-extension.md).
However, this way lefts styling completely for the library user.
